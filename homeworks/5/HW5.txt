CS220 Week 5 Homework Due Oct. 04, 2015

Name: William Jagels

1. Given the following C declarations:
	char * str1="This is a test";
	char str2[100]="This is only a test";
	
   How many bytes of memory will be used to store str1 and str2?
        15 bytes for str1
        100 bytes for str2

2. Given the C declaration: int AR_3D[16][4][8];

	a) How many integers can be stored in AR_3D?
        512
	b) How many bytes of memory are required to hold AR_3D?
	    2048
	c) Will a reference to AR_3D[j][k][3] cause a compiler error if j=11 and k=5?
        Nah, C is cool like that.
	
	d) Will a reference to AR_3D[j][k][3] cause a logical error if j=11 and k=5?  If so, why?
        Yes, it will access values from another dimension
	
3. Given the following C code...

	int DATA[][4]={10,11,12,13,14,20,21,22,23,24};
	int *arrPtr=&DATA[1][3];
	printf("The confusing answer is %d\n",(*(++arrPtr)));
	
   What will get printed?
        23
    
   
4. True or False?

	__F_ A flop is a Computer Science student who forgot to study.
	
	__F_ Floating point addition is easier than floating point comparison.
	
	__F_ Running 100K C instructions will always run faster than running 200K instructions.
    One C instruction can take longer than 200k instructions.
	
	__T_ One SONY Playstation 4 can run as fast as 17 million IBM 1620 mainframe machines.
    In terms of FLOPS, yes.
