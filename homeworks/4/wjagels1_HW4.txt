CS220 Week 4 Homework Due Sep. 27, 2015

Name: William Jagels

1. Given the following C code:
    int x = 1000000001;
    float fx=x;
    if (x==fx) printf("x and fx are the same");
    else printf("x and fx are different");

   ... what will get printed?  Why?

        x and fx are the same because the float will be cast to an integer for comparison

2. Given the following C code:
    float frac=foo();
    float base=bar();
    int percent=100*frac/base+0.5;

   a) If foo() returns the value 5.56 and bar() returns the value 20.0, what will the value of percent be?
        28
   b) Why did the programmer add 0.5 to the expression used to calculate percent?
        To round up the number

3. Given the following C code:
    int func(char a[],char b[]) {
        while((*a)) if (*a++)!=(*b++)) return 0;
        if ((*b)) return 0;
        return 1;
    }

   a) What will func("string 1","string 1") return?
        1
   b) What will func("string 1","string") return?
        0
   c) What does func do?
        Tests if 2 char arrays are exactly equal

 4. Are the following statements true or false...

    a) _T_ I can always debug my code using printfs
        Sure, you can print whatever you want in C.

    b) _F_ In gdb, if I type "n", and hit enter twice, I will execute exactly two C statements
        Does not go into functions.

    c) _F_ In gdb, if I type "b 21 if (i>20)", then gdb will stop the next time I execute line 21
        Only if i is greater than 20

    d) _T_ In gdb, if I type "p myfn(x*3)", where x is a variable and myfn is a function in my
        code, then gdb will print out the return value of myfn.
