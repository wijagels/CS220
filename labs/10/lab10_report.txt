CS-220 Fall 2015 Lab 10 report		Due: Nov 06, 2015

Name: William Jagels

1. What is the deepest level of stack frame nesting that occured in the factorial program?
    6 levels of nesting.

2. What information can you derive from a dump of the fact function's stack frame?
    Local variables, the previous frame, and the caller's return address.

3. When you printed the entire stack, it included main's frame, including the value of the first
   parameter to main.  What value does this parameter have, and why?
    1 because argc is always 1 when no additional arguments are passed

4. Can you think of any good ways to improve the printout of the stack frame information?  If so, how?
    Enclose the stack in lines so separate copies of the stack are more clearly separated.

5. Can you think of any other reason for using the capability for C to access or use information or
   instructions at the X86 level? If so, describe what you would do in a sentance or two.
    If a programmer thinks they can write better code than the compiler, they can do it.  Or, if it's a device driver, sometimes it's important to have full control over what's in the registers or how things are executed.
