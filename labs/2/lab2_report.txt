CS-220 Fall 2015 Lab 02 Report

1. What prevents the "factorial" function from invoking itself forever?
    The if statement that returns 1 if the argument is 1.

2. What is the largest number that you can use to compute a correct factorial using "char" as the returned value?  Why?
    5 because 6! is larger than 127

3. What is the largest number that you can use to compute a correct factorial using "unsigned char" as the returned value?
        5 because 6! is larger than 255
    Is this different from signed char?  If not, why not?  If so, why?
        It's the same because 6! is larger than both the limits
	
4. What type of integer data allows factorial to return the largest correct result?  
        unsigned long long int
    What is the largest argument for which factorial returns a correct result using this type?
        20

5. What is the largest value for which this program can compute an exact and correct result?
        25!
	What type of data produces this largest value?
        long double.  Perhaps __float128 will provide larger numbers, but I haven't been able to get it to work yet.
