1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of a command line interface?
    Disadvantages:
        Steep learning curve
        Makes people think you're a hacker
        Dangerous if misused
    Advantages:
        Available on any POSIX compatible system
        No restrictions on what you can and can't do
        Standardized input and output
        Easy to create pipelines
        Can be used to automate monotonous tasks
        Customizable and extensible
        Can run headless

2. Why did rmdir fail when there was a test.txt file in the junk directory?  Is this a good thing?
    It failed because rmdir's purpose is to "remove empty directories".  This is a good thing because the command refuses to do more than what it's intended for.

3. What does the "helloWorld" program you copy-pasta'd do?
    It prints a message to standard output and then exits.

4. What was the value of "argc" in gdb?  Why was argc this value?
    It's 3.  argc is argument count.  The first argument is the run path and the other two are 'testing' and 'arguments' making a total of 3 elements.

5. What was the value of "argv[1]" in gdb? Why was "argv[1]" this value?
    "testing" because this is the first parameter passed to the program, which is located directly after the run path in argv.
