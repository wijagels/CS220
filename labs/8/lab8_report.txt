	_x_ Growing Developping Beginner
	___ Getting Dastardly Bugs

2. What gdb command would you use to display the first four 4 byte hexidecimal values
   starting at the top of the stack?
    x/4aw $ebp
3. What gdb command would you use to determine the size of the current stack frame in bytes?
    p $ebp-$esp
4. Would your job have been easier if "wumpus" was compiled with debug turned on?
    Yeah, because then you'd have information about lines
5. Were you surprised at how much information you could figure out about the wumpus executable
   even though debug was not turned on?  Is knowledge of X86 useful?
    Yup, now it's time to debug proprietary software.  x86 seems extremely useful for reverse engineering.
